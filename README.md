## Importance of Logical Programming, Installation and Usage
**Logical programming** is a programming paradigm that is particularly well-suited for **knowledge representation** and **reasoning**. 

It allows for the expression of facts and rules in a declarative manner, enabling systems to infer new information based on existing data. This is crucial in domains like nutrition, where complex relationships exist between food items, ingredients, and health outcomes.

Using logical programming in the development of this ontology offers several advantages:
- **Expressiveness:** Logical programming enables the representation of complex relationships and constraints among various entities, which is essential for accurately modeling nutritional information and dietary recommendations.
- **Inference Capabilities:** By leveraging reasoning engines, the ontology can automatically infer new relationships and properties. For instance, if a user has a dietary restriction, the system can infer which dishes are suitable based on the ingredients they contain.
- **Consistency Checking:** Logical programming allows for the validation of the ontology's consistency. This ensures that all defined relationships and properties adhere to the specified rules, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of the data.
